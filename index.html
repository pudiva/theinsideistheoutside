    <h1>the inside is the outside</h1>

    <p>Structuring of the Self<br/>
    as proposed by Lygia Clark (Brazil, 1920-1988)</p>

    <h2>how is the session setting?</h2>

    <p>The participant is invited to lie down (or find another comfortable position to stay in).</p>

    <p>I place the Relational Objects on their body.  The participant remains in contact with the Relational Objects for most of the session. Then the objects are moved and removed.</p>

    <p>We have a moment to integrate the experience at the end.</p>

    <p>Examples of Relational Objects are: small cushions with fine sand, plastic bags with water or air, bags of stone and air (named breathe with me), ventilation tubes, loofah rolls, big styrofoam ball cushions, stones, seashells.</p>

    <h2>how it may serve you</h2>

    <p>Structuring of the Self can serve to reactivate a fruition skill or a quality of aesthetic experience.</p>

    <p>Processes of violence, oppression and everyday demands make our bodies produce hard carapaces.  By practising opening up these carapaces, we open up ways of contact both inside-out and outside-in.</p>

    <p>With the use of Relational Objects, a setting is created in which one can experience an openness to letting themselves be affected by &ldquo;external forces&rdquo;. These &ldquo;external forces&rdquo; are in the memory of the participant&rsquo;s body already.</p>

    <p>The proposition can facilitate the access to tides and memories that are prior to speech and reasoning/ rationalisation.  In this sense, it may generate valuable associations that can be taken to the talking therapy or the psychoanalytic classical setting.</p>

    <p>The objects activated during Structuring of the Self have no symbolic charge in themselves and, in contact with the body, serve as points of support, expansion, dilution, filling, etc.</p>

    <p>It may facilitate access to living spaces and bodies with which we have had contact and are understood as &lsquo;past&rsquo; memories. When these memories are experienced in their embodied presence, we may find/create new ways to integrate them.</p>

    <p>Structuring of the Self might help counterflow dissociation experience by making it easier to experience the body with its weights, textures and edges during an extended period of time.</p>

    <p>The session can be a way of relaxing and resting in a germinative way.</p>

    <h2>who</h2>

    <p>I&rsquo;m Ta'wa, an artist/cultural worker from Taguatinga-DF/Brazil, currently living in London/UK.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been researching Lygia Clark&rsquo;s Structuring of the Self since 2011.</p>

    <p>I approach this proposition and the uses of relational objects as a social practice, in intersection with the instauration of abolition geographies and collective liberation processes.</p>

    <p>I had investigated the impact of a consistent implementation of Structuring of the Self  within a psychiatric hospital ward, aiming to erode spaces and practices of imprisonment and alienation. Additionally, I had explored the origins of the Structuring of the Self  proposition, particularly as it relates to Lygia&rsquo;s conviviality with sex workers. More recently, I&rsquo;ve also been looking at how the objects serve as bridges to access the body and its memories - with the aim to open our resonating capacity, connecting with being beyond ourselves – a practice in tune with the principles of Buen Vivir from the cosmovisions of Quechua, Aymara and Guarani Peoples from Abya Yala.</p>

    <h2>where</h2>

    <p>The sessions take place in South East London - UK</p>

    <p>The current location does not offer step-free access, but accommodations are possible, such as home-visits.</p>
